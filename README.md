# Portal
This is my Portfolio site, it's currently under construction but feel free to look at my code. I'm build it using SCSS with CSS Grids, HTML 5 and some Vanilla JS.

I'm using Grunt to run a local webserver as well as compiling my SCSS & to handle the JS linting.

This is an ongoing project so check back to see it progress!
